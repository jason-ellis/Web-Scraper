 * A web scraper that uses input from CSV files placed in the same directory as the
 * application. Outputs a CSV file with results.
 *
 * The web scraper has a specific purpose to search a div with id HLMFfooter for strings
 * that the input CSV file specifies. This is to check for a specific issue where HTML
 * is generated with errors in production environment.
 *
 * All CSV files are separated by line breaks, one value per line, no quotes.
 * url.csv file is used to obfuscate site I'm searching for privacy reasons.
 * input.csv and idNames are required because sites are formatted as:
 * https://xxx.xxx.com/_unique_id_/yyyy
 *
 * Required files:
 * url.csv - The URL to scan. For intended purpose, this app uses a URL on line 1, appends
 *      the path from identifier.csv, and then (optionally) appends the 2nd line from url.csv.
 * input.csv - List of identifiers/paths concatenated to URL in url.csv.
 * checklist.csv - List of strings to search for and return PASS if they are not present,
 *      FAIL if they are present.
 * output.csv - Results of scraping are printed to this file
